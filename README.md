## Research questions:
1) Is a link graph?
2) What is the diameter of the graph?
3) Is there at least one single junction?


## Familiar algorithms that were used: BFS.

## Data representation:
### Link graph:
     1 - Link
     0 - No link
### Graph diameter:
     1 - Infinity
     -Any other number reflects the size of the diameter of the graph.
### At least one single junction:
     1 - exists
     0 - does not exist
