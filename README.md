## Research questions:
1) Random graph- connectivity\non-connectivity?
2) What is the diameter of the graph?
3) Random Graph - Can it contain an isolated vertex?


## Familiar algorithms that were used: BFS.

## Data representation:
### Connectivity of graph:
     1 - Connectivity 
     0 - Non-connectivity
### Graph diameter:
     1 - Infinity
     -Any other number reflects the size of the diameter of the graph.
### Isolated vertex:
     1 - Exists
     0 - Does not exist
