## Research questions:
1) Random graph- connectivity\non-connectivity?
2) What is the diameter of the graph?
3) Can a random graph contain an isolated vertex?


## Familiar algorithms that were used: BFS.

## Data representation:
### connectivity of graph:
     1 - connectivity 
     0 - non-connectivity
### Graph diameter:
     1 - Infinity
     -Any other number reflects the size of the diameter of the graph.
### isolated vertex:
     1 - exists
     0 - does not exist
